            The Vedic tradition respects and worships every cow as the universal Mother Goddess. Taking good care of cows is believed to immensely please the Supreme. Moreover, every product from the cow - the Go-Mutra (cow’s urine), cow dung, cow milk, etc possess religious significance as well as high medicinal properties. But, sadly, in recent times, cows that are meant to be worshipped and revered are cruelly slaughtered. The increasing rate of cow slaughter and beef export is a very depressing and shocking truth prevailing in the present days. Hence, to protect and nourish cows, Sreemath Hariharapura conducts Cow Protection Programmes at many places in and around South India. Volunteers from Sreemath campaign against cow slaughter, creating awareness among people about the need to protect cows. Plans are on to set up Goshalas at various locations, where cows can be protected and nourished in the best possible manner. Presently, there is a Goshala at Hariharapura, called the “Brindaavana Goshaala”, where cows whether barren or old, young or milking, calves or infants - ALL are nourished and taken care under best medical facilities. Presently there are about 100 cows in this Goshala.
