            The Glories of Guru Upadesha are boundless. Initiation from a
            Sadguru is a very rare treasure and indeed the greatest boon of
            life. Guru Upadesha becomes the best Saadhana to achieve Chittha
            Shudhhi (internal purity). It breaks the cage of worldliness and
            leads to the Supreme Atma Gnyaana.

            The Shiva Deeksha programme does not end at a mere one day
            celebration. Sreemath Hariharapura ensures an all time bond with
            the devotees who take part in this programme. Every year, for the
            Shivarathri Pooja, Mruthika Lingas are sent to the all the
            locations where the Shiva Deeksha programme had been conducted.
            Devotees at the locality perform Pooja to this Shiva Linga with
            their own hands on the auspicious Shivarathri night.

            Gayatri Upasana is a very ancient worship that is said to bestow
            prosperity, courage and harmony. It is also believed that this
            Upasana improves the memory power, grasping capacity, brilliance
            and intellect of an individual. The Vishwa Gayatri Upaasak Parishat
            is a scheme in which women are taught to perform the Gayathri
            Upasana, by worshipping Vedamatha Gayathri Devi based on Sastras,
            with Gayathri Sahasranama. Presently around 1,00,000 women in and
            around South India have learnt this Upaasana.
